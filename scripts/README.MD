This script uses the uaac CLI to create a uaa client for the nozzle.  Note that some sample use a UAA user which then requires 
using an OAuth password grant to get a token.  For the sample we've chosen to use a UAA client which allow for setting a authorization 
token lifetime when creating the client.
